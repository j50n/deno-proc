# WebAssembly with Deno and Odin

A practical guide for building WebAssembly applications using Deno and Odin.

## What This Book Covers

This is a hands-on guide that takes you from first WASM module to production deployment. We use Odin as our systems language (clean syntax, excellent WASM support) and Deno as our runtime (first-class WASM integration).

By the end, you'll understand:

- The runtime bridge between WASM and JavaScript
- Memory management patterns that work
- How to build, test, and deploy WASM modules

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with TypeScript and Deno. Prior Odin experience isn't required—we cover what you need as we go.

## Structure

**Part I: Getting Started** — Environment setup, the runtime bridge, testing patterns.

**Part II: Core Concepts** — Numbers, memory, strings, error handling.

**Part III: Advanced Patterns** — Memory management, multiple instances, real-world applications.

**Part IV: Building & Shipping** — Build automation, performance, deployment.

## The Foundation Example

Throughout this book, we build and extend a single example in `examples/foundation/`. It starts simple and grows with your understanding.

Let's get started.
