# Test File for WASM Line Processing

This is a sample file to demonstrate the WASM line processor.
Each line will be processed individually with length prefixes.

Lines can contain various content:
- Short lines
- Much longer lines with lots of content that spans across multiple words and contains various punctuation marks!
- Lines with special characters: àáâãäåæçèéêë
- Numbers: 123456789
- Mixed content: Line 42 has 7 words and 123 numbers

The processor handles:
✓ Unix line endings (\n)
✓ Windows line endings (\r\n)
✓ Partial lines across chunk boundaries
✓ Empty lines
✓ UTF-8 content

Performance is excellent for streaming data processing!
