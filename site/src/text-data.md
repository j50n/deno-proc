# Working with Text Data

## `UTF-8` Chunked Lines

Blah.

## Traditional Text and Lines

Deno provides a native
[TextDecoderStream](https://deno.land/api?s=TextDecoderStream) to bulk-convert
`Uint8Array` data into text. The boundaries are arbitrary. The characters will
always be correct, but this can break within a word or within a
control-character sequence.

## Something Something Positional \r Etc.

Blah.
