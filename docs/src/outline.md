- Misc.
  - Using the spread operator with `run()`
    - `run(...["ls", "-la"] as Cmd)`, because it needs a tuple; Typescript sees
      it a `string[]` unless you cast to the tuple
    - or `run("ls", ...args)` works
    - _this is standard Typescript behavior, but we don't run into it that
      often_
