Merged stub pages (custom-errors, stderr, performance, cache, writable) into parent pages\n2. Updated SUMMARY.md to remove merged pages\n3. Improved introduction.md with better \"Who is this for\" section and more professional tone\n4. Improved key-concepts.md with clearer enumeration explanation and reduced repetition\n5. Enhanced error-handling.md with custom error handling, stderr content, and better comparison with Deno.Command\n6. Enhanced running-processes.md with expanded performance tips and clarified Cmd type\n7. Improved pipelines.md with better tee() explanation\n8. Expanded parallel-downloads.md from 1KB to 5KB with real examples, retry logic, rate limiting\n9. Added \"When to Use\" sections to concurrent.md and streaming.md\n10. Reduced repetition in quick-start.md with cross-references and simpler example\n\nModified files: introduction.md, key-concepts.md, error-handling.md, running-processes.md, pipelines.md, parallel-downloads.md, concurrent.md, streaming.md, quick-start.md, enumerable.md, SUMMARY.md\nDeleted files: custom-errors.md, stderr.md, performance.md, cache.md, writable.md"],"modified_files":["/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/introduction.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/getting-started/key-concepts.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/core/error-handling.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/core/running-processes.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/core/pipelines.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/recipes/parallel-downloads.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/advanced/concurrent.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/advanced/streaming.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/getting-started/quick-start.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/iterables/enumerable.md","/home/dev/ws/deno-proc/site/src/SUMMARY.md"],"id":"1762017195915"}
